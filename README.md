# Deep Structured Active Contours (DSAC)

In this code, we combine the expressiveness of deep CNNs with the versatility of ACMs in a unified framework, which we call Deep Structured Active Contours (DSAC). In essence, we employ a CNN to learn the energy function that would allow an ACM to generate polygons close to a set of ground truth instances.
